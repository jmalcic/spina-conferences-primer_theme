          was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouth which you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an
          island which was larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for the travelers of that time to cross from it to the

          all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidently a haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder
          is a real ocean, and the land surrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, a continent. Now in this

          over many other islands also and parts of the continent.</div>
